# Julia-for-optimisation

## Getting Started
You need to use Jupyter Notebook, Julia 1.6.2, and FICO Epress MP throughout the course.

### Install Anaconda and Jupyter Notebook
- If you already have Jupyter Notebook installed, go ahead and install Julia (jump right into the next step)
- If you don’t have Jupyter Notebook on your local machine, [install Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual-d)

### Install Julia
<!-- *For Windows* -->
1. [Download Julia V1.6.2](https://julialang.org/downloads/) and install: follow the installation instructions
2. Open Julia Command-Line: in the windows search bar type in ‘Julia’ and click on ‘Julia 1.6.2’
3. In Julia Command-Line, type the following commands one after another

    - Type in ``using Pkg`` and then press Enter

    - Then type in ``Pkg.add(“IJulia”)``, press Enter, and wait for the package to be added

4. Now let's create your first Julia notebook!
    - Run jupyter notebook. (If you are not familiar with Jupyter Notebook, follow the short instruction [here](https://pythonforundergradengineers.com/opening-a-jupyter-notebook-on-windows.html)) 
    - Click on the “New” button at the top right of your local jupyter notebook server, then choose “Julia 1.6.2”

    - Once a new jupyter notebook is set up, you should see Julia’s icon on the *top right* of the new notebook
